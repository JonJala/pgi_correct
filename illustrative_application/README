This folder contains all required scripts and datasets to replicate Table 3 of Becker
et al.

./papageorge_thom/
A slightly edited replication package from Papageorge and Thom
(https://www.nber.org/papers/w25114). All data needed for the replication are publicly
available, but one will need to make an account with HRS to access their data.
More detailed instructions on replication are at ./papageorge_thom/GenesEduc_ReadMe.do
-- read this document carefully. The replication package will produce a table,
EA_CrossSection.dta, that will be needed to reproduce Table 3.

./replication/
This contains the scripts to reproduce the estimates in Table 3. The first script
processes the data for input to pgic.py. The second script calls pgic.py.
For more instructions, read ./replication/README.
