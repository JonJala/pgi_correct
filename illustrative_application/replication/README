The scripts in this folder are used to prepare and estimate the regression models in
Table 3 of Becker et al.


1.make_reg_data.do
Short stata script to clean regression data, generate interactions and dummies, drop
linearly dependent columns, etc. Just need to point the script to the cross section
from Papageorge and Thom, EA_CrossSection.dta. The script will insert pgic input data
for each regression:
    - reg1: regression of EA on EA PGI.
    - reg2: regression of EA on EA PGI, controlling for parental EA.
    - reg3: first GxE regression, outcome is at least high school.
    - reg4: second GxE regression, outcome is at least college.


2.replicate_estimates.sh
Short bash script to call pgic.py which will generate original and corrected
coefficient estimates (Table 3 of Becker et al.) Just need to activate your pgic
virtualenv to ensure package compatibility. Virtualenv activation instructions at
../../README.md. Even if not replicating our results, we encourage users to familiarize
themselves with this script as an example of how to properly call the pgic tool.
